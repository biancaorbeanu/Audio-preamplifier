## Overview
A voltage-controlled preamplifier is an electronic device that amplifies an input signal, and its gain is determined by a control voltage applied to a dedicated terminal.

## Initial Design Data
- **Power supply**: 12V
- **Input signal**: 0-20mV
- **Frequency**: 2kHz
- **DC control voltage**: 0-2V
- **Voltage-controlled gain**: 1-20
